# The Docker run directory

This directory includes docker-compose files that are used for quickly deploying the controller and agent for testing

For more details see the Wiki on how to start up the orchestrator

To start, place your properties.json and other required files next to docker-compose.yml and type

Note: You still need to manually setup Kubernetes for the controller.

```
docker-compose up
```
